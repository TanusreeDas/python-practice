âœ… Why not Recursion?
We have already implemented the algorithm using recursion, however, "Binary Search" is usually more efficient when implemented iteratively rather than recursively. Hereâ€™s why:
	â€¢	Recursion adds extra function calls, which consume more stack memory.
	â€¢	Each recursive call stores variables & return addresses in the call stack, leading to increased memory usage.
	â€¢	Python has a default recursion limit (usually ~1000 recursive calls) before raising a RecursionError.
	â€¢	Recursive calls require extra CPU cycles to manage the function call stack.
	â€¢	Iterative methods directly modify variables and avoid the cost of function call management.
	ðŸš€ When NOT to Use Recursion:
	â€¢	When the problem can be solved iteratively without recursion overhead.
	â€¢	When the recursion depth could be too high (e.g., 1,000,000 elements in an array).
	â€¢	When performance matters (Recursion can be slower in Python).

Concept:
	â€¢	Divide-and-Conquer: Repeatedly divides the dataset into halves.
	â€¢	Requires Sorted Data: Works only on sorted datasets (ascending or descending order).
	â€¢	Space Complexity: O(1) (iterative) or O(\log n) (recursive).

How it works:
	â€¢	Identify the middle element of the current range.
	â€¢	Compare the target with the middle element: If equal, return the middle index, if smaller, discard the right half, if larger, discard the left half.
	â€¢	Repeat on the remaining half until the target is found or the range is empty.
