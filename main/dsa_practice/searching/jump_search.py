âœ… Why not Recursion?
We have already implemented the algorithm using recursion, however, "Jump Search" is usually more efficient when implemented iteratively rather than recursively. Hereâ€™s why:
	â€¢	Recursion adds extra function calls, which consume more stack memory.
	â€¢	Each recursive call stores variables & return addresses in the call stack, leading to increased memory usage.
	â€¢	Python has a default recursion limit (usually ~1000 recursive calls) before raising a RecursionError.
	â€¢	Recursive calls require extra CPU cycles to manage the function call stack.
	â€¢	Iterative methods directly modify variables and avoid the cost of function call management.
	ðŸ”¹ Jump Search (Recursive vs Iterative) Space complexity:
	â€¢	Recursive: Calls itself multiple times for block jumps: O(âˆšn) (due to recursion stack).
	â€¢	Iterative: Simply loops through blocks: O(1) (only uses a few variables).
	ðŸš€ When NOT to Use Recursion:
	â€¢	When the problem can be solved iteratively without recursion overhead.
	â€¢	When the recursion depth could be too high (e.g., 1,000,000 elements in an array).
	â€¢	When performance matters (Recursion can be slower in Python).

Concept:
	â€¢	Jump in Fixed Steps: Moves in steps of size sqrt{n} through the array.
	â€¢	Localized Search: After a potential range is identified, linear search is performed within that block.
	â€¢	Time Complexity: O(âˆšn), Space Complexity: O(1).

How it works:
	â€¢	Start at the first element and jump ahead by âˆšn steps.
	â€¢	Stop jumping when the current element exceeds or equals the target.
	â€¢	Perform a linear search within the block from the previous jump to the current position.
	â€¢	If the target is found, return its index; otherwise, return -1.
